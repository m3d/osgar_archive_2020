OSGAR - Open Source Python Library for Autonomous Field Robots

OSGAR (Open Source Garden/Generic Autonomous Robot) is lightweight
multi-platform Python library targeting record and replay of multiple `nodes`
(modules = sensors, robots, applications) logged into single file. It has
similar goals as ROS[1] or ADTF[2], but is minimalistic. It should run on
different operating systems and also low end devices like Raspberry PI Zero.

In this paper we present basic OSGAR functionality, show applications on
autonomous robots Spider3 Rider, modified garden tractor John Deere X300R and
small robot Eduro used for measurements in maize field.

OSGAR can be used also as recording tool for various scientific experiments.
We give a simple example how to record existing sensors using serial, CAN bus,
HTTP/TCP/UDP interfaces and demo example how to write your own driver
targeting specific hardware.
