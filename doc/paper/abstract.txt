OSGAR (Open Source Garden/Generic Autonomous Robot) is lightweight
multi-platform Python library targeting record and replay of multiple `nodes`
(modules = sensors, robots, applications) logged into single file.

There are two main goals: 
 * allow for deterministic replay of recorded sessions (like `rr` [1])
   to enable debugging of software running on robots
 * allow for later reprocessing of recorded data from sensors (like ADTF [2])

While ROS [3] can record and replay, the result is inherently not deterministic
due to the way the communication is implemented within ROS. Also ROS has a very
specific runtime requirements while OSGAR aims to be minimalistic
and focuses only on Python - it should run on
different operating systems and also low end devices like Raspberry PI Zero.

In this paper we present basic OSGAR functionality, show applications on
autonomous robots Spider3 Rider, modified garden tractor John Deere X300R and
small robot Eduro used for measurements in maize field.

OSGAR can be used also as recording tool for various scientific experiments.
We give a simple example how to record existing sensors using serial, CAN bus,
HTTP/TCP/UDP interfaces and demo example how to write your own driver
targeting specific hardware.

The software is available at GitHub [4] and as Python package [5]. It is
developed and maintained in cooperation with Robotika.cz [6].
