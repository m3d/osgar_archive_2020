The Basic Usage

The OSGAR task is defined by a configuration file. It contains list of nodes
(processing modules) and connection links (pair of source and destination
node). Each node has specific initialization section, containing for example
TCP port, list of input and output streams, and "driver", which is the name of
the class implementing required functionality.

There are two typical steps: recording the data and replay already recorded
data. While the real run is executed on deployment machine, the replay should
behave identically on laptop for example, without real-time constrains.
Debugging and detail analysis is based on logfiles only.

JSON is used as format for the configuration files. For convenience a set of
multiple JSON files is allowed to avoid necessity to specify all used
combinations. Finally driver "app" is dedicated for "application", which is a
Python node as direct command line parameter.

Usage examples:
python3 -m osgar.record config/my-gps.json
python3 -m osgar.replay <logfile> --module <selected node name>

Convenience "app" usage:
python3 -m osgar.followme run config/my-robot.json
python3 -m osgar.followme replay <logfile>
