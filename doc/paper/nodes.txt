The Nodes

Each node (processing unit) communicate with other nodes with blocking
functions "listen()" and "publish()". Listen returns tupple containing
timestamp of the message, channel name and the data. The timestamp is standard
Python datetime.timedelta with resolution in microseconds starting from zero
at the beginning of the program. The time is defined by recording computer.
Note, that at the beginning also absolute datetime is stored so it is possible
to compare times of multiple logfiles if necessary.

The message data can be any basic Python type: numbers, arrays, dictionaries
etc. Note, that used "msgpack" serialize both lists and tuples into an array,
so for reproducebility we recommend to use lists only.

Also float numbers depend on resolution and it is different for different
number value. We recommend fractions (fixed decimal point) often used in CAN
bus communication.

The "publish()" method contains channel name and data. It returns current time
so node can measure current processing delay. The distribution of messages
among nodes is hanled by OSGAR system. Current solution is with a queue of
messages created for each node.
