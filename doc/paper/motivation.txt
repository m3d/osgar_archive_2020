The Motivation

Our original motivation was still growing number of robots among which we
wanted to share the code. The common part was used programming language
(Python), set of sensors (SICK lidars, IP cameras, GPS) and control of the
robot via CAN.

Each sensor was recorded into separate log file in proprietary format. CAN
communication was binary, lidars used Python array serialization via str()
function and images from camera were stored as separate JPEG file with one
index file. The recording was tightly linked to given application, like
navigation of the robot in the row of a maize field.

The new generation of OSGAR was based on unified timestamped message format,
support of multiple individual streams stored in a single logfile and general
tools for visualization and data post-processing.
