Spider3 Rider

Spider3 is omnidirectional 4-wheel platform modified for autonomous data
collection. There are two control modes: Spider and Car. In "spider mode" are
all wheels pointing in the same direction. Speed and desired direction are
used for control.

In "car mode" turning radius and speed are specified.



Record GPS data

This is an example of JSON configuration for recording GPS data only:
{
  "version": 2,
  "robot": {
    "modules": {
      "gps": {
          "driver": "gps",
          "in": ["raw"],
          "out": ["position"],
          "init": {}
      },
      "gps_serial": {
          "driver": "serial",
          "in": [],
          "out": ["raw"],
          "init": {"port": "COM5", "speed": 4800}
      }
    },
    "links": [["gps_serial.raw", "gps.raw"]]    
  }
}

It has two nodes named "gps" and "gps_serial", where the first one takes care
of parsing GPS NMEA sentences while the second communicates with the device
over serial port (COM5, speed 4800bps). The communication is only one-way from
serial port to the parser.
