Message Types
=============

.. glossary::

   emergency_stop
      Boolean if Emergency STOP was pressed. Should be reported on system start
      and on change.

   encoders
      List of differences of all available encoders since the last update. For two
      wheeled robot they shell be ordered [left, right]. Positive difference
      corresponds to forward motion. The scaling factor is specific to robot
      and can change over time (preasure in tires, payload). The main purpose
      of this message type is an advanced position estimation.

   gps_position
      [longitude_ms, latitude_ms] - GPS coordinates in WGS84 system. Scaled
      3600000 (i.e. in milliseconds)

   pose2d
      [x, y, heading] - position in meters with heading in radians
      (anticlockwise). Scale 1000x (i.e. x, y are send in millimeters)
      and angle in 1/100th of degree.

   desired_speed
      [speed, angular_speed] - command used for differentially driven robots.
      Speed is in meters per second scalled 1000x (i.e. millimeters per second)
      and angular_speed in radians per second, scaled to 1/100th degree per
      second.
